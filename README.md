* Need to implement handlebars templates to put the data into before loading
* Stack of places visited and back buton to pop
* Cache
* Styling for native feel
* Page transition (I Hear this is hard)
* Streamline server with api to get data without all the extra stuff we don't need (just the content div sans styling)
